In general, though, it references a persistent digital space where users can be immersed in a virtual or augmented reality. And although the idea may be new to investors, one company has a huge head start on building part of the metaverse.Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) has been offering a platform that brings millions of people together in a virtual space since its founding in 2004. The platform is different from many others because it is free to play, and relies on games created by a community of developers, as well as purchases of Robux, its platform-specific virtual currency.
